# Netflix Content Analysis 📊

This project presents an end-to-end SQL-based data analysis of a Netflix content dataset. It includes data cleaning, preprocessing, and analytical queries to extract insights about the types, distribution, and performance of movies and shows.

---

## 📁 Dataset Overview

* **Table Name:** `content_library`
* **Source:** Netflix dataset (CSV format, imported into SQL Server)
* **Fields include:**

  * `title`, `type`, `runtime`, `genres`, `release_year`
  * Ratings from IMDb and TMDB
  * Country, certification, and more

---

## 🧹 Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

1. **Previewed the data** using `SELECT TOP(5)`
2. **Counted nulls** in all columns and addressed them:

   * Deleted rows with missing `title`
   * Filled `description`, `age_certification`, `imdb_id` with default values
   * Handled malformed country values (e.g., `[]` changed to `'Unknown'`)
   * Replaced missing ratings and votes with column averages
     
3. **Verified `seasons` column**:

   * Confirmed all `NULL` values belong to `MOVIE` type
   * Ensured no `SHOW` had missing season data
    
4. **Checked for duplicates**: None found

**Note:** Some runtime values suggest unrealistic durations. These are retained as-is to demonstrate outlier detection in real-world messy datasets.
